The OpenEngine Repository Directory
======================================================================

This directory contains the darcs repositories for OpenEngine.

* Installing Repositories

  To install a new repository you must use darcs to upload it to
  daimi.

  $ darcs put user@fh.daimi.au.dk:/users/cgd/code/projects/MyProject

  After that you must login to daimi and execute the repo-install
  script. This will make the repository editable for other daimi
  users.

  $ ssh user@fh.daimi.au.dk
  $ /users/cgd/bin/repo-install /users/cgd/code/projects/MyProject

  Your repository is now ready to be used by others :)


* Directory Structure

openengine/
  This is the heart of OpenEngine. You will need a copy of this
  repository to work on OpenEngine.

  $ darcs get user@fh.daimi.au.dk:/users/cgd/code/openengine

extensions/
  Many of the various extensions for OpenEngine are in this folder.
  More info can be found at: http://openengine.dk/wiki/Extensions

projects/
  Many of the various project build on OpenEngine are in this folder.
  More info can be found at: http://openengine.dk/wiki/Projects

branches/
  Working branches of the main repository, extensions and projects are
  placed in this folder. These copies should be considered very
  unstable (as should all of OpenEngine ;)
  When working on new features you should create a branch here if you
  intend to work others during the development.

  Please prefix all branched repositories with a branch-id. This will
  make it easy for others to see which repositories belong to the
  branch. For example:
    myfeature-main
    myfeature-opengl
    myfeature-sdl
